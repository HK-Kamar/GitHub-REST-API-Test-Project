 ## Description
 
 In this project, I have tried to get 10 most committers of 5 different repositories by using GitHub's API and Java Programming Language. 
 
 Disclaimer: Final test couldn't have been finished due to rate limits of the API.
 
 ## How does it work?
 
 1- The program goes through all the commits of target repository and puts each committer in a set (to avoid dublicates).
 
 2- If the committer is not added to the set yet, it is being added while also creating an object with which holds its username and commit count (1 default)
 
 3- If the committer is already added to the set, the commmit count of its related object is increased.
 
 4- After finishing this process, all the committers are sorted among each other according to their commit counts. 
 
 5- Then, 10 most committers (if number of committers less than 10, then all of them) are written in to a text file with their username, location and company information.
 
 6- Since all the necessary tests haven't been made, there might have been some bugs incase of a null returning. Be aware!
 
 7- I have created a Flask Server and cached some of the JSON responses of the GitHub API to be able to do at least some tests. 
 
 8- During tests, I have used a localhost which I have implemented by using Flask. The URL line of it can be found under the source files (commented-out).
 
 ## How to run?
 
 You may run the program by downloading "Github-REST-API-v3-Test-Project.jar" and "execute.bat" files and then executing the .bat file. 
 
 Note: It is highly possible that you will receive a 403 error which is related to the GitHub API Rate Limit. 
 
 When you click on the link on the error text you can see a page that says:
 
 "{"message":"API rate limit exceeded for *Your IP NUMBER*. (But here's the good news: Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the documentation for more details.)","documentation_url":"https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting"}"
